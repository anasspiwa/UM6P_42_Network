# 🏊 UM6P 42 Piscine – My Journey

Welcome to my repository!  
This is a collection of all the projects I completed during the **42 Piscine at UM6P**.  
It reflects my progress, problem-solving mindset, and growing mastery of C, algorithms, and shell programming.

## 📂 Projects Overview

### C Language Modules
- **c00 → c09**: Step-by-step mastery of the C programming language  
  - Basics: functions, loops, and conditions  
  - Memory: pointers, arrays, and dynamic allocation  
  - Advanced: recursion, string manipulation, and structured programming

### Shell Projects
- **shell00**: First steps in Unix and shell scripting (permissions, simple commands, file system basics)  
- **shell01**: Deeper shell usage (advanced commands, pipelines, automation)

---

## 🧑‍💻 Skills Gained
- Strong foundation in **C programming**
- Proficiency in **Unix/Linux environment**
- **Problem-solving under pressure** and fast learning
- Collaboration and peer-to-peer learning (core philosophy of 42)

---

## 🚀 Why This Matters
The Piscine is not just coding — it’s an **intense bootcamp** where adaptability, persistence, and teamwork are tested every day.  
Completing it demonstrates:
- Ability to **learn by doing**
- Resilience in solving difficult problems
- Discipline to work through challenges without shortcuts

---

## 📌 Notes
This repository is meant to **document my journey**, not to provide ready-made solutions.  
If you’re a Pisciner, try the exercises yourself first — that’s where the real growth happens 😉.
